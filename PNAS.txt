Generic
language
in
scientific
communicationAbstractScientific
communication
poses
a
challenge
To
clearly
highlight
key
conclusions
and
implications
while
fully
acknowledging
the
limitations
of
the
evidence
Although
these
goals
are
in
principle
compatible
the
goal
of
conveying
complex
and
variable
data
may
compete
with
reporting
results
in
a
digestible
form
that
fits
increasingly
limited
publication
formats
As
a
result
authors
choices
may
favor
clarity
over
complexity
For
example
generic
language
e
g
Introverts
and
extraverts
require
different
learning
environments
may
mislead
by
implying
general
timeless
conclusions
while
glossing
over
exceptions
and
variability
Using
generic
language
is
especially
problematic
if
authors
overgeneralize
from
small
or
unrepresentative
samples
e
g
exclusively
Western
middle
class
We
present
4
studies
examining
the
use
and
implications
of
generic
language
in
psychology
research
articles

a
text
analysis
of

149
psychology
articles
published
in
11
journals
in
2015
and
2016
examined
the
use
of
generics
in
titles
research
highlights
and
abstracts
We
found
that
generics
were
ubiquitously
used
to
convey
results
89%
of
articles
included
at
least
1
generic
despite
that
most
articles
made
no
mention
of
sample
demographics
Generics
appeared
more
frequently
in
shorter
units
of
the
paper
i
e
highlights
more
than
abstracts
and
generics
were
not
associated
with
sample
size
Studies

found
that
readers
judged
results
expressed
with
generic
language
to
be
more
important
and
generalizable
than
findings
expressed
with
nongeneric
language
We
highlight
potential
unintended
consequences
of
language
choice
in
scientific
communication
as
well
as
what
these
choices
reveal
about
how
scientists
think
about
their
data
Recent
discussions
of
scientific
practices
in
the
social
sciences
reveal
2
themes
that
appear
to
be
at
cross
purposes
On
the
one
hand
there
is
increasing
concern
about
samples
that
are
limited
in
scope
and
generalizability
Research
in
psychology
often
relies
on
samples
from
WEIRD
Western
educated
industrialized
rich
and
democratic
societies
that
are
unrepresentative
of
people
the
world
over
1–3
Furthermore
sample
sizes
are
often
underpowered
4–6
at
times
leading
to
conclusions
that
do
not
hold
up
with
larger
sized
replications
or
meta
analyses
7
At
the
same
time
scientists
are
increasingly
encouraged
to
describe
their
work
in
an
accessible
manner
to
reach
out
to
broad
audiences
and
to
make
bold
interesting
claims
about
the
wider
implications
of
their
findings
tweets
TED
talks
and
so
forth
8
These
trends
are
reflected
in
the
introduction
of
new
condensed
formats
such
as
research
highlights
and
metrics
that
focus
on
popularity
and
uptake
journal
impact
factors
H
indexes
AltMetrics
Together
these
2
themes
present
a
challenge
for
scientific
writing
To
communicate
key
findings
in
an
accessible
and
concise
manner
while
fully
and
responsibly
acknowledging
the
variability
and
limits
of
the
evidence
Precision
may
be
sacrificed
when
attempting
to
reach
a
broader
audience
and
diversity
in
findings
may
be
ignored
For
example
university
press
releases
contain
more
exaggerated
advice
exaggerated
causal
claims
and
exaggerated
inference
to
humans
from
animal
research
than
the
original
peer
reviewed
journal
articles
they
summarize
9
Does
scientific
writing
itself
also
fall
prey
to
similar
tendencies
Here
we
examine
one
way
that
authors
of
peer
reviewed
scientific
reports
make
choices
that
favor
brevity
over
precision
We
focus
on
the
use
of
generalizing
claims
based
on
limited
evidence
Broad
claims
about
infants
Whites
Millennials
women
or
adolescents
with
seasonal
affective
disorder
Examples
include
Whites
and
Blacks
disagree
about
how
well
Whites
understand
racial
experiences
Americans
overestimate
social
class
mobility
animal
but
not
human
faces
engage
the
distributed
face
network
in
adolescents
with
autism
or
women
view
high
level
positions
as
equally
attainable
as
men
do
but
less
desirable
This
tendency
has
been
recognized
in
science
writing
informally
for
decades
Oyama
10
11
argued
that
when
reasoning
about
human
nature
theorists
often
conflate
incidence
relative
frequency
or
probability
of
a
trait
with
essence
a
hidden
truth
rooted
in
the
past
and
already
there
Thus
people
often
pose
general
questions—such
as
Are
people
at
their
core
aggressive
or
peaceful
selfish
or
altruistic
rational
or
irrational
—rather
than
viewing
behavior
within
a
dynamic
developmental
system
12
Siegler
likewise
suggests
that
developmental
psychologists
tend
to
focus
on
questions
such
as
[W]hat
is
the
nature
of
5
year
olds
thinking
and
how
does
it
differ
from
the
thinking
of
8
year
olds
treating
each
age
group
as
a
uniform
and
static
entity
rather
than
considering
the
variability
within
each
age
group
and
processes
of
continuous
change
12
Similarly
Barrett
13
suggests
that
scientists
may
unwittingly
incorporate
essentialist
assumptions
into
their
theorizing
ignoring
or
downplaying
variation
in
favor
of
averages
or
central
tendencies
resulting
in
reports
that
extend
beyond
the
evidence
imply
unwarranted
uniformity
and
universality
and
downplay
variability
and
contextual
influences
A
tendency
to
generalize
broadly
from
samples
and
gloss
over
variation
with
law
like
statements
could
be
especially
problematic
when
combined
with
the
lack
of
diversity
of
participants
in
most
social
science
studies
noted
earlier
14
Rogoff
15
and
Gutiérrez
and
Rogoff
16
warn
of
overly
general
claims
e
g
children
do
such
and
such
that
assume
a
timeless
truth
and
generalize
too
quickly
to
other
populations
without
evidence
These
statements
hide
that
study
participants
typically
include
a
limited
and
unrepresentative
group
of
individuals
and
imply
that
this
group
is
the
norm
and
that
their
behaviors
attitudes
and
perceptions
are
universal
Gutiérrez
and
Rogoff
recommend
replacing
such
broad
claims
with
past
tense
statements
that
convey
what
was
observed
in
a
given
situation
the
children
did
such
and
such
noting
Only
when
there
is
a
sufficient
body
of
research
with
different
people
under
varying
circumstances
would
more
general
statements
be
justified
16
Generalizing
from
WEIRD
samples
also
encourages
deficit
thinking
when
participants
from
non
WEIRD
samples
perform
differently
this
is
often
described
as
abnormal
or
problematic
15
17–19
The
most
common
means
of
expressing
generalizations
is
via
generic
language
statements
regarding
categories
such
as
dogs
are
4
legged
or
tigers
have
stripes
20–27
Generics
make
broad
claims
about
a
category
as
a
whole
as
distinct
from
individuals
without
reference
to
frequencies
probabilities
or
statistical
distributions
Thus
the
generic
claim
people
use
the
availability
heuristic
implies
a
broader
truth
in
contrast
to
the
people
in
this
study
used
the
availability
heuristic
describing
the
behavior
of
individuals
within
a
sample
most
people
in
this
study
used
the
availability
heuristic
describing
a
probability
or
60%
of
people
in
this
sample
used
the
availability
heuristic
describing
a
statistical
likelihood
Generics
have
been
observed
across
all
languages
that
have
been
studied
20
and
they
are
understood
and
produced
early
in
childhood—by
about
2
5
y
of
age
27
28
—earlier
than
the
acquisition
of
quantifiers
such
as
all
some
or
most
29–31
They
appear
to
be
a
default
mode
of
generalization
with
quantified
statements
often
misremembered
as
generic
32
Generics
have
important
semantic
implications
They
gloss
over
exceptions
and
variability
For
example
one
can
say
birds
fly
even
though
penguins
and
ostriches
do
not
fly
one
can
say
lions
have
manes
even
though
only
male
lions
have
manes
and
one
can
say
mosquitoes
carry
the
West
Nile
virus
even
though
fewer
than
1%
of
mosquitoes
do
so
22
25
Moreover
generics
regarding
animal
kinds
exhibit
an
asymmetry
People
need
relatively
little
evidence
to
make
a
generic
claim
but
generic
claims
are
interpreted
as
applying
broadly
to
the
category
33–35
This
is
not
true
of
quantifiers
such
as
all
or
most
for
which
evidence
and
interpretation
match
up
precisely
Generics
are
resistant
to
counter
evidence
for
example
the
claim
introverts
and
extraverts
require
different
learning
environments
36
is
not
disconfirmed
by
an
instance
of
an
introvert
and
an
extravert
who
require
the
same
learning
environment
Furthermore
generics
imply
that
a
feature
is
conceptually
central
37–40
and
can
lead
to
higher
rates
of
essentialism
41
Generics
may
also
imply
that
a
statement
is
normatively
correct
or
ideal
39
40
42
43
For
all
of
these
reasons
expressing
a
finding
generically
may
lead
readers
to
think
that
a
scientific
result
is
especially
important
because
it
is
conceptually
central
and
universal
robust
because
it
is
normatively
correct
or
generalizable
because
it
downplays
variability
and
exceptions
To
this
point
however
the
use
and
interpretation
of
generic
language
in
science
writing
has
been
unexplored
The
goal
of
the
present
paper
is
to
conduct
a
systematic
examination
of
the
frequency
of
generic
language
in
reporting
results
of
psychology
publications
to
examine
competing
hypotheses
regarding
their
contexts
of
use
and
to
examine
how
lay
readers
interpret
such
statements
Because
generics
are
a
default
mode
of
generalization
and
the
most
common
means
of
expressing
generalizations
in
natural
language
including
for
variable
tendencies
that
do
not
uniformly
apply
in
all
instances
we
anticipated
that
they
would
be
widely
used
to
express
results
in
the
psychological
sciences
Because
generics
gloss
over
exceptions
and
imply
that
variation
does
not
exist
we
hypothesized
that
they
may
more
likely
be
found
in
articles
that
choose
not
to
report
how
individuals
in
their
samples
vary
from
one
another
Similarly
because
generics
are
universalizing
and
imply
that
findings
are
broadly
true
regardless
of
time
and
place
we
hypothesized
that
findings
expressed
with
generic
language
would
be
interpreted
as
more
important
and
conclusive
by
lay
readers
even
if
there
was
little
evidence
linking
the
use
of
generic
language
by
authors
and
the
evidentiary
basis
for
their
findings

goal
of

1
was
to
assess
the
frequency
of
generic
language
in
a
corpus
of
scientific
papers
in
psychology
We
focused
on
psychology
because
of
the
participant
sampling
issues
that
are
acute
in
the
social
sciences
including
overreliance
on
WEIRD
populations
and
small
sample
sizes
Journals
were
selected
to
range
broadly
across
subfields
biological
clinical
cognitive
developmental
social
to
have
relatively
high
impact
factors
and
to
include
research
highlights
or
similar
short
summaries
as
well
as
abstracts
Analyses
were
restricted
to
titles
highlights
and
abstracts
because
these
tend
to
be
the
most
read
components
44
and
may
be
critical
in
determining
whether
an
article
is
sent
for
review
or
read
further
Furthermore
researchers
may
resort
to
generics
especially
when
word
counts
are
restricted
which
is
true
for
all
3
of
these
components
We
included
all
articles
published
in
2015
and
2016
in
11
journals
excluding
articles
that
did
not
report

For
each
article
we
coded
each
complete
sentence
in
the
title

and

that
pertained
to
the
results
of
the
study
These
were
coded
as
either
generic
sentences
in
1
of
3
forms
see
below
or
nongeneric
sentences
Generics
were
general
timeless
claims
regarding
categories
or

concepts
e

and
were
coded
as
1
of
3
types
Bare
framed

Bare
is
a
generic
sentence
that
is
unqualified
and
not

to
any
particular
study

as

Framed
is
a
generic
that
is
unqualified
but
is
framed
as
a
conclusion
from
the
particular
study
that
was
conducted
such
as
Moreover

such
as

Sentences
were
coded

and
typically
were

Sentence
fragments
that
omitted

e

were
excluded
from
our
analyses
because
they
were
unable
to
reveal
whether
the

was

e
g
implicit

determines
effort
related
cardiac
response
or
not
e
g
implicit

was
associated
with

Sentences
were
excluded
from
the
coding
of
the
highlights
or

if
they
referred
to
previous
research
or
methodology
to
restrict
comparisons
to
the
research
findings
on
which
generic
claims
were
based
We
considered
all
titles
to
pertain
to
the
results
because
titles
often
alluded
to
an
undifferentiated
combination
of

Generics
were
hypothesized
to
be
prevalent
across
content
areas
of
psychology
given
the
frequency
of
generics
in
natural
language
and
their
utility
for
making
broad
claims
in
the
face
of
variable
data
We
begin
by
reporting
the
frequency
of
generic
language
in
our
sample
as
baseline
data
We
then
examine
whether
generics
are
linked
to
features
of
the
articles
including
the
format
length
i
e
Are
generics
more
common
in
shorter
or
longer
formats
and
sample
features
i
e
Are
generics
more
common
in
articles
that
included
larger
samples
Generics
were
also
hypothesized
to
be
independent
of
the
evidentiary
basis
for
the
claim
i
e
generics
were
not
expected
to
be
more
frequent
in
articles
with
more
participants
or
participants
from
more
diverse
backgrounds
given
that
they
are
a
default
mode
of
generalization
Finally
generics
were
hypothesized
to
be
more
frequent
in
shorter
than
longer
formats
titles
and
highlights
vs
abstracts
given
that
generics
entail
the
absence
of
specification
and
thus
are
typically
shorter
than
nongeneric
claims
22
A
corollary
to
this
prediction
was
that
when
generics
were
used
shorter
formats
e
g
titles
and
highlights
vs
abstracts
were
expected
to
elicit
higher
rates
of
unqualified
bare
generics
compared
to
framed
and
hedged
generics

that
bare
generics
are

In

to

we
were
also
interested
in
the
varieties
of
generic
language
that
were
employed
Bare
generics
were
unqualified
compared

generic
statements
that
were
qualified

way

within
the
context

so
the

Because
bare
generics
have
fewer
linguistic
elements
we
predicted
that
such
forms
would
be
more
common
in
shorter
formats
To
test
this
hypothesis
a
test
was
performed
on
sentences
that
were

as
generic
bare
framed
or

A

Associations
between
Generic
Language
and
Sample
Features
In
addition
to
coding
generic
language
we
also
coded
features
of
the
participant
samples
in
each
article
with
the
goal
of
examining
whether
generic
language
use
was
related
to
the
evidentiary
basis
of
the
articles
sample
size
[the
number
of
participants]
and
sample
diversity
[variation
in
participants
racial/ethnic
socioeconomic
and
language
backgrounds]
as
well
as
journal
impact

These
data
are
reported

Notably
most
articles
did
not
specify

race/ethnicity
73%
socioeconomic
status
79%
or

74%
Because
most
articles
did
not
even
report
this
information
we
were
unable
to
relate
generic
language
to
sample
diversity
Therefore
we
instead
conducted
an
analysis
to
test
whether
generics
were
more
frequently
used
for
articles
that
glossed
over
participant
demographics
by
comparing
studies
that
reported
participant
background
to
studies
that
did
not

To
do
so
a
multilevel

was
conducted
on
the

of

046To
summarize
the
results
of
study
1
Generic
language
was
frequently
used
to
characterize
psychological
results
across
a
broad
range
of
highly
ranked
journals
This
practice
was
especially
common
in
shorter
article
formats
such
as
titles
and
highlights
which
provide
less
opportunity
to
communicate
nuances
in
the
findings
or
limitations
of
the
work
Generic
sentences
were
also
less
likely
to
be
framed
or
hedged
in
shorter
article
formats
Generic
use
was
unrelated
to
the
evidentiary
basis
of
the
claim
as
measured
by
the
features
of
the
sample
coded
from
the
articles
Articles
that
recruited
a
larger
sample
were
not
more
likely
to
include
generics
than
articles
that
reported
smaller
samples
For
the
2
features
that
were
associated
with
generic
usage
reporting
of
SES
and
language
background
generic
language
use
was
inconsistently
related
to
authors
reporting
of
sample
features
Articles
that
did
not
report
the
socioeconomic
background
of
the
participants
were
more
likely
to
use
generic
language
whereas
those
that
did
report
the
language
background
were
more
likely
to
use
generic
language
Reporting
on
these
factors
may
have
qualitatively
different
roots
Authors
who
report
SES
might
be
more
sensitive
to
the
constraints
of
their
findings
in
their
reporting
and
therefore
be
less
likely
to
use
generics
In
contrast
papers
that
report
language
are
often
specifically
asking
questions
pertaining
to
language
and
comparing
groups
this
tendency
was
much
more
common
in
the
Journal
of
Memory
and
Language
an
outlier
in
this
regard
72%
reported
language
than
other
journals
language
reporting
ranged
from
8
to
37%
It
is
possible
that
these
comparisons
could
elicit
more
generic
language
These
hypotheses
are
speculative
but
would
be
interesting
directions
for
future
study

To
summarize
participants
in

judged
findings
expressed
with

as
more
important
and
at
times
more
generalizable
and
drawing

Nonetheless
the

we
sought
to
replicate
and
extend
the
findings
of

2
by
testing
a
broader
range
of
linguistic
cues
to
nongenericity
Language
can
signal
nongenericity
in
a
rich
variety
of
ways
and
most
prior
research
has
provided
a
starker
contrast
between
generic
and
nongeneric
than
was
provided
in

2
28–35
For
example
whereas
study
2
only
manipulated
tense
in
the
published
literature
nongenerics
typically
manipulated
the
noun
phrase
itself
e
g
This
X…
Some
Xs…
thus
drawing
attention
more
explicitly
to
the
limited
scope
of
the
generalization
Thus
studies
3a

aim
to
examine
the
semantic
contrast
when
nongenerics
are
cued
in

of

General
DiscussionThe
tendency
to
ignore
variation
well
documented
in
participant
recruitment
is
echoed
in
scientific
writing
In
a
sample
of
over
1
000
articles
published
in
11
psychology
journals
over
a
2
y
period
nearly
90%
of
articles
included
generics
in
the
summary
of
research
results
study
1
We
found
no
evidence
that
this
usage
was
warranted
by
stronger
evidence
as
it
was
uncorrelated
with
sample
size
Instead
authors
showed
an
overwhelming
tendency
to
treat
limited
samples
as
supporting
general
conclusions
by
means
of
universalizing
statements
e
g
Juvenile
male
offenders
are
deficient
in
emotion
processing
These
generalizing
statements
covered
a
wide
range
of
categories
and
constructs
People
women
children
adults
people
with
schizophrenia
self
promoters
early
bilinguals
the
brain
the
human
orbitofrontal
cortex
statistical
learning
mortality
salience
parental
warmth
social
exclusion
zero
sum
beliefs
emotion
regulation
effortful
control
human
decision
making
to
name
just
a
smattering
The
present
study
may
even
underestimate
the
frequency
of
generics
in
scientific
writing
because
we
focused
strictly
on
sentences
describing
study
results
in
titles
highlights
and
abstracts
thus
excluding
summaries
of
prior
findings
in
the
literature
reviews
or
implications
in
the
discussion
sections
On
the
other
hand
because
authors
may
resort
to
generics
more
often
when
word
counts
are
restricted
the
rates
of
generics
may
be
higher
in
these
more
condensed
portions
of
the
paper
Common
language
practices
thus
contribute
to
a
gap
between
the
limitations
of
research
evidence
and
the
generality
of
conclusions
These
results—notable
in
their
own
right—have
2
further
implications
First
generic
language
in
scientific
articles
may
lead
readers
to
reach
exaggerated
conclusions
Past
research
found
that
generic
sentences
implied
that
a
property
was
broadly
true
28
35
45
46
and
conceptually
central
37
38
and
that
the
category
expressed
was
stable
with
inherent
properties
41
47
In
the
present
work
studies
2
to
4
similarly
revealed
that
both
online
workers
and
undergraduates
studying
psychology
judged
research
summaries
with
generic
language
to
be
more
important
than
nongeneric
summaries
and
under
certain
circumstances
to
be
more
generalizable
and
conclusive
At
the
same
time
the
present
effects
were
small
and
subtle
and
readers
were
more
sensitive
to
language
differences
when
multiple
converging
cues
were
provided
e
g
Some
people
with
dysphoria
were
less
sensitive
to
positive
information
in
the
environment
or
People
with
dysphoria
were
less
sensitive
to
positive
information
in
certain
situations
Thus
in
order
to
communicate
potential
limits
on
generality
authors
may
need
to
employ
more
explicit
linguistic
signals
A
second
implication
of
study
1
is
as
a
window
on
how
scientists
conceptualize
data
Namely
the
widespread
use
of
generics
suggests
a
widespread
tendency
on
the
part
of
authors
to
gloss
over
variation
Indeed
despite
a
near
universal
tendency
to
report
empirical
results
in
generic
terms
over
70%
of
the
papers
we
sampled
supplied
no
clear
information
about
participants
race
SES
or
language
consistent
with
other
findings
in
the
literature
48
Those
articles
providing
no
information
about
participants
SES
were
more
likely
to
include
generics
in
their
results
summaries
although
papers
that
provided
information
about
participants
language
background
were
more
likely
to
include
generics
than
those
that
did
not
Even
when
this
information
was
provided
there
was
little
consistency
in
how
it
was
reported
or
even
where
it
appeared
Writing
as
if
variation
does
not
exist
downplays
the
importance
of
sampling
broadly
and
may
lead
to
inappropriately
aggregating
across
diverse
groups
or
treating
underrepresented
groups
as
deficient
19
49
There
likely
are
converging
reasons
for
the
ubiquity
of
generic
language
Generics
may
often
be
an
unwitting
default
reflecting
how
generalizations
are
typically
expressed
in
natural
language
For
example
when
conducting
this
research
we
were
chastened
to
discover
unintended
generics
in
our
own
published
writing
e
g
including
claims
about
children
rather
than
a
sample
of
English
speaking
children
raised
in
one
middle
class
US
community
50
At
the
same
time
bolder
framing
such
as
this
may
be
a
deliberate
choice
resulting
from
perverse
incentives
when
scientists
have
to
convince
journals
funding
agencies
and
the
broader
public
of
the
importance
of
their
research
14
51
52
In
a
climate
in
which
submissions
are
routinely
rejected
by
top
journals
and
funding
agencies
even
a
small
effect
of
viewing
generic
summaries
as
more
important
could
play
a
role
in
what
is
published
or
funded
It
is
also
possible
that
an
accumulation
of
small
but
consistent
effects
can
build
to
result
in
larger
disparities
53
Generic
language
may
also
result
from
writing
guidelines
and
best
practices
that
recommend
using
concise
compact
language
and
that
provide
generics
as
examples
of
good
writing
54–56
Editorial
policies
requiring
more
condensed
formats
may
also
play
a
role
Recall
that
in
study
1
shorter
elements
of
an
article
titles
and
highlights
compared
to
abstracts
contained
more
generics
and
proportionately
more
unqualified
generics
than
did
longer
elements
of
an
article
Finally
there
may
be
fashions
that
spread
among
a
scientific
community
For
example
Rosner
51
found
striking
increases
over
time
and
differences
across
disciplines
in
the
use
of
assertive
sentence
titles
defined
as
complete
sentences
that
assert
a
conclusion
and
[having]
the
form
of
an
eternal
truth
which
typically
are
generics
over
97%
of
the
titles
coded
as
generic
in
study
1
followed
this
format
Although
the
present
studies
highlight
the
ubiquity
of—and
potential
problems
with—using
generic
language
to
describe
research
findings
it
may
be
unrealistic
to
expect
generics
to
disappear
given
all
of
the
factors
reviewed
above
A
more
fruitful
approach
may
be
that
proposed
by
Simons
Shoda
and
Lindsey
14
which
they
call
constraints
on
generality
The
basic
suggestion
is
that
each
published
paper
should
include
a
statement
that
identifies
and
justifies
the
authors
beliefs
about
a
study
s
target
populations
The
participants
stimuli
procedures
and
cultural/historical
contexts
to
which
the
results
are
likely
to
generalize
14
Being
explicit
about
these
assumptions
reminds
the
reader
of
the
limitations
of
the
sample
and
provides
a
clear
set
of
conditions
that
can
be
tested
by
others
The
present
studies
have
several
such
limitations
First
study
1
was
restricted
to
psychology
journals
that
included
highlights
or
short
summaries
It
is
an
open
question
as
to
whether
the
same
patterns
would
be
obtained
in
other
disciplines
or
for
journals
that
do
not
require
these
additional
brief
elements
Second
most
of
our
experimental
studies
did
not
include
professionals
in
the
field
e
g
students
of
psychology
research
psychologists
who
have
greater
knowledge
and
expertise
and
thus
might
more
easily
overlook
how
a
paper
was
written
in
evaluating
the
importance
or
generality
of
the
conclusions
Note
however
that
study
3c
included
college
students
studying
psychology
and
their
responses
were
comparable
to
those
of
the
online
sample
Conversely
the
participants
in
these
studies—highly
educated
English
speaking
participants
in
the
United
States
with
internet
access—may
be
more
skilled
at
making
subtle
distinctions
in
language
than
other
populations
Finally
participants
only
read
one
sentence
summaries
of
findings
thus
it
is
an
open
question
whether
readers
might
have
different
interpretations
when
presented
with
longer
material
with
a
mix
of
generic
and
nongeneric
language
as
is
typically
the
case
with
published
abstracts
To
conclude
further
study
is
important
to
understand
the
scope
and
consequences
that
oversimplifying
scientific
findings
has
for
the
interpretation
of
those
findings
by
experts
students
and
the
public
Psychology
and
many
fields
of
scientific
inquiry
are
confronting
important
questions
as
to
the
extent
to
which
what
was
considered
to
be
foundational
knowledge
in
the
field
needs
to
be
contextualized
with
attention
to
cultural
differences
15
19
57
and
the
transparency
and
replicability
of
research
efforts
6
7
Considering
the
language
used
to
communicate
those
findings
may
be
one
important
step
to
raising
awareness
of
these
issues
